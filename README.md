# Jebadiah

Jebadiah (Jeb for short) is an open decision model. It answers small typed questions about a piece of structured
state, and instead of writing text it returns a calibrated probability over the allowed answers. This repository
holds everything needed to reproduce it: the trainer and evaluator, the data builders, the evaluation harnesses, the
configuration of every run, and the result record of every run we report.

We train it with [AINode](https://github.com/getainode/ainode)'s trainer on public data and serve it through
AINode's `/v1/decide` and `/v1/systemone` routes. The published weights live on Hugging Face under
[frontier-infra](https://huggingface.co/frontier-infra).

## What a System One decision model is

Most software that uses a language model today asks it to write a paragraph and then parses the paragraph. A lot
of that traffic is really a decision: which team should take this ticket, does this reply answer the question, how
severe is this alert. A System One model answers those directly, in one forward pass, the way fast intuitive
judgment works in people. Its consumer is code, not a person.

That changes what matters. The answer must be one of the allowed options, every time. The probability must mean
something, so the caller can act on a high one, escalate a middle one and hand a low one to a person or a larger
model. The same question must get the same answer, under load and when irrelevant noise in the input changes. And
it must be cheap enough to run on every event. Jebadiah reads its answer from the logits of single label tokens at
one position, so there is no generation, no parsing and no refusal path; policy is built by the caller from the
probabilities.

## The three question types

A request carries a `state` (any JSON) and one or more questions. Each question has a type, an instruction and
criteria.

- **choice**: pick one of N named options. Returns a probability for every option.
- **noul**: a yes or no statement. Returns P(true).
- **score**: place the state on an ordered rubric (for example five helpfulness levels). Returns a probability for
  every level; the expected level is the useful summary.

```json
{
  "state": {"ticket": "Customer says the invoice total does not match the quote."},
  "questions": {
    "route": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should take this ticket?",
              "criteria": {"billing": "an invoice, a charge or a refund", "support": "a product question",
                           "sales": "a quote or a renewal"}},
    "urgent": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "The customer is blocked from working.",
               "criteria": {"true": "work has stopped", "false": "it can wait"}}
  }
}
```

## How training works

- **Prompt contract.** Every question is rendered with AINode's own decide prompt (`train/ainode_prompt_verbatim.py`
  is a verbatim copy of `ainode.api.decide.build_messages` at source commit `e5c08938`, hash-pinned), through the
  base model's chat template with thinking off. Options are shown as single-token labels (A, B, C ... and up to 68
  labels; `train/jebadiah_prompt.py`). The same bytes are used at training, evaluation and serving time;
  `train/test_prompt_identity.py` checks the copy against an AINode checkout.
- **Objective.** Cross-entropy over the candidate label logits at the answer position only
  (`train/train_jebadiah.py`). Choice and noul train toward the source's gold distribution where it has one, else the
  hard label. Score questions train toward an ordinal kernel around the human label (the adjacent level gets 0.2 of
  the label's weight). Nothing else is supervised and nothing is generated. The candidate logits are computed in
  fp32 from the last hidden state (`train/jebadiah_model.py`).
- **Adapter.** LoRA rank 16, alpha 32, dropout 0.05 on every linear projection including the Gated DeltaNet ones:
  32.5M trainable parameters on the 4B and 43.3M on the 9B. One epoch, learning rate 1e-4 with a cosine schedule,
  30 warmup steps, micro-batch 8, bf16, seed 17. Every setting is in `configs/sweep.json`.
- **Calibration.** A 5 percent calibration slice is split off by family hash (`data/split_pool.py`), so sibling
  records never straddle it. After training, one temperature per question type is fitted on it
  (`train/fit_temperature.py`); the published temperatures are in `configs/temperatures/`.
- **Evaluation.** `train/eval_jebadiah.py` scores 20 test sets with repeats and option-order shuffles, and records
  accuracy, the Jevals Decision Score, Brier, ECE, flip rates and latency for every row. `train/postprocess.py` and
  `train/sweep_lib.py` roll that up into the run's `results.json`. The **headline** is the macro accuracy over five
  zero-shot sets (Jevals PubMedQA, Banking77 and HelpSteer2, Nimble's 324-question eval set, Kev transfer v4) plus the
  macro over Nimble's 13 public human-labelled subsets counted as one component. The two sets that share sources
  with the training pool (typed-decisions test, Kev decision v7 test) are reported beside it, not in it.
- **Data.** Public, license-checked sources only: `LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions`, the Kev v7 training sources whose
  licenses permit derived weights (BoolQ, MNLI, DBpedia14 and Kev's contrastive and composition sets), HelpSteer2
  train and SummEval, with every evaluation item excluded. `data/convert_data.py` downloads and converts them; every
  source, revision, license and exclusion is recorded in `data/manifests/convert-data-v1.json`. Later pools add our
  synthetic set and public human yes/no sets (see the experiments).

Accuracy in percent (repeat 0). DSj is the Jevals Decision Score: 100 is perfect, 0 is guessing the base rates.
All numbers are ours, measured with the evaluator in this repository. Every run, including the ones we did not
publish, is in [`results/SUMMARY.md`](results/SUMMARY.md), generated from the records by `scripts/results_table.py`.
Per-question evaluation rows are not committed here (about 13 MB per run); the published model repositories carry
them for their own runs under `eval/`.

## The story, v0 to v2

**v0** was the recipe: LoRA on the Qwen3.5 Base checkpoints, candidate-label cross-entropy, public data only, one
epoch. It added about four headline points over the untrained 9B, and two epochs were worse than one. Its weak spot
was the score type: on human helpfulness ratings it was confidently wrong, with a Decision Score of -21 on HelpSteer2.
([01](experiments/01-v0-recipe.md))

**v1** added human-rated score data (HelpSteer2 train and SummEval) and changed the score target from the teacher's
spread to an ordinal kernel around the human label, with the temperature fitted on that same target. The 9B's
HelpSteer2 Decision Score went from -21.4 to 11.9 and its calibration error there from 0.39 to 0.045. Its rubric
accuracy did not move: the model became honest about not knowing helpfulness rather than better at judging it. The 4B
paid for the extra score data with 5.6 points on Nimble's set. ([02](experiments/02-v1-rubric-data.md))

**Between v1 and v2** we tried to grow the data. A 14,714-question synthetic pool authored and labelled by our own
teacher models made the 9B worse ([03](experiments/03-v2-synthetic-pool.md)). A fifth of synthetic choice questions,
with no synthetic yes/no, helped the 4B a little ([04](experiments/04-choice-dose.md)). A teacher bake-off against a
human answer key showed the open teachers' labels were 12 to 13 points below a frontier model's
([05](experiments/05-teacher-bakeoff.md)), but re-targeting the synthetic pool with the best teacher did not move our
headline ([06](experiments/06-fable-targets.md)). Public human yes/no data and a small slice of our own human labels did
not lift the human yes/no evaluation sets either, and on the 9B the smaller score share cost HelpSteer2
([07](experiments/07-human-yes-no.md)). None of these beat v1.

**v2** came from the one change we had not tried: the starting checkpoint.

## The chat-checkpoint finding

The same v1 recipe and the same v1 pool, trained on the Qwen3.5 chat checkpoints with thinking off instead of the
Base checkpoints, gave the best 4B and the best 9B we have. On the 4B it is worth 2.15 headline points (72.49 against
70.34) with no new data, more than any data change we made, and it removes 4B v1's regression on Nimble's set (77.2
against 71.9). On the 9B the gain is 0.64 points (73.93 against 73.29), most of it on Nimble's set; the other
components move less than a point and the HelpSteer2 Decision Score is lower (10.4 against 11.9). No record carries a
significance test, so we treat the 4B gain as real and the 9B gain as small. The two chat runs were merged into the
base weights and published as v2. ([08](experiments/08-chat-checkpoint.md))

Two other properties held across versions. Answers are stable under noise: with a random id planted in the state,
trained models keep 96 to 100 percent of their choice and yes/no picks, and the untrained 4B loses 6 accuracy points
on Banking77 where the trained one loses none ([09](experiments/09-nonce.md)). And the model is honest about rubric
questions it cannot answer well, which is what calibration is for.

## Where we stand on JevBench

[JevBench](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/jevbench) (v1.4.2) is a public benchmark for exactly this kind of model.
We ran its 231 public items through its own unchanged harness ([10](experiments/10-jevbench.md)).

| System | Public accuracy (231) | Hard tier (111) | Hard-tier ECE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Jebadiah 9B v2 | 0.818 | 70 | 0.052 |
| Jebadiah 9B v1 | 0.818 | 71 | 0.127 |
| Jebadiah 4B v2 | 0.758 | 57 | 0.088 |
| Jebadiah 4B v1 | 0.762 | 56 | 0.087 |
| JPT-4B (self-reported) | 0.879 | 87 | |
| Jev 1.13.0 (board) | 0.866 | 81 | |
| Hopper (board) | 0.823 | | |

Candidly: Jebadiah is below every leading model on the board's public items. The easy and standard tiers are at the
ceiling; the whole gap is the hard tier, where the model most often takes the planted surface answer, above all on
temporal and numeric items. The chat checkpoint did not close that gap. It did make the 9B much better calibrated
where it is wrong. These are self-run public numbers; the board's ranking also uses sealed items that only its
maintainer runs, and we have not been measured there. Nothing in this repository was tuned toward JevBench, and an
overlap check found no shared 8-word span between our training pool and its public items.

We also submitted 9B v1 to the [Decision Index](https://github.com/apolinario/decision-index)
([apolinario/decision-index#8](https://github.com/apolinario/decision-index/pull/8)); the engine is in
`eval/decision-index/` ([11](experiments/11-decision-index.md)).

## Run it yourself

`server/` is a standalone server for the published models. It runs on one CUDA GPU or an Apple Silicon Mac and
needs Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
cd server && uv run jebadiah-serve --model frontier-infra/jebadiah-4b-v2
```

The model downloads on first start (the default, without `--model`, is the 9B). Then open the playground at
<http://localhost:8000/>, or call the API: `POST /v1/systemone` takes the request shape above, `POST /v1/decide` takes
AINode's shape, and the schemas are at <http://localhost:8000/docs>. Flags, auth, latency and caveats are in
[`server/README.md`](server/README.md).

## Reproduce a run end to end

You need one NVIDIA GPU with 80 GB (we used H100 PCIe and A100 80 GB PCIe; a DGX Spark also works, slowly), about
200 GB of disk and Ubuntu with the driver installed. No tokens are needed: every model and dataset is public.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getainode/jebadiah && cd jebadiah

# 1. environment, base models, public data (about 20 to 30 minutes)
sudo JEB_ROOT=/workspace/jeb bash scripts/setup.sh
cat /workspace/jeb/READY

# 2. train, fit temperatures, evaluate, write results.json (about 110 minutes for the 9B v2 run on an A100)
bash /workspace/jeb/run_sweep.sh --only 9b-chat-v1
bash /workspace/jeb/run_sweep.sh --status

# 3. compare with the published record
python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/workspace/jeb/runs/9b-chat-v1/results.json'))['headline'])"
python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('results/runs/9b-chat-v1/results.json'))['headline'])"
```

`setup.sh` stages the code from this checkout into `$JEB_ROOT`, installs a Python 3.12 environment with pinned
`transformers` and `peft`, downloads every base model named in `configs/sweep.json` at its pinned revision, and builds
the v1 pool and all 20 test sets with `data/convert_data.py`. Its `pool.jsonl` should match the sha256 recorded in
`data/manifests/pools.json` (`python3 data/pool_manifest.py check /workspace/jeb data-v1`). Any run in
`configs/sweep.json` can be named with `--only`; runs are resumable and a finished run is skipped. The nonce test runs
after training with `JEB_NONCE_RUNS=9b-chat-v1 bash /workspace/jeb/nonce_all.sh`.

Runs on the v0 pool (`data`) used an earlier state of the converter (manifest in
`data/manifests/convert-data-v0.json`); as committed, the converter builds the v1 pool, so the v0 runs are recorded
here but not rebuilt by `setup.sh`.

The later pools need more than public downloads:

| Pool | How it is built |
|---|---|
| `data-v2` | `data/pool-v2/generate.py` and `finalize.py` against an AINode endpoint serving the two teachers (`JEB_TEACHER_BASE_URL`, `JEB_TEACHER_KEY`). The result is published as the dataset [frontier-infra/jebadiah-synth-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/frontier-infra/jebadiah-synth-v2). |
| `data-dose-c20`, `data-dose-c33` | `data/dose/make_dose_pool.py` from the v1 pool and the synthetic records |
| `data-v3-c20f`, `data-v3-c20f-n3k` | `experiments/fable-targets/` (needs a logged-in Claude Code for the Fable calls) |
| `data-dose-c20h`, `data-dose-c20h-alt` | `data/human-noul/convert_human_noul.py`, then `make_c20h_pools.py` |
| `data-v3-c20fh-alt`, `data-v3-full`, `data-v3-full-s` | `data/compose_pools.py`, verified byte for byte against the manifest |
| `data-v2b`, `data-v2-cn`, `data-v2-score` | filtered inline during the sweep; the builder was not kept, only the sha256 |

Copy a built pool directory into `$JEB_ROOT` and name it in the run's `data_dir`.
